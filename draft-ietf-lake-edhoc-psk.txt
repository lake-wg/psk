             EDHOC Authenticated with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
                    draft-ietf-lake-edhoc-psk-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication method
   for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key exchange
   protocol.  The PSK method enhances computational efficiency while
   providing mutual authentication, ephemeral key exchange, identity
   protection, and quantum resistance.  It is particularly suited for
   systems where nodes share a PSK provided out-of-band (external PSK)
   and enables efficient session resumption with less computational
   overhead when the PSK is provided from a previous EDHOC session
   (resumption PSK).  This document details the PSK method flow, key
   derivation changes, message formatting, processing, and security
   considerations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication method
   for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key exchange
   protocol [RFC9528].  The PSK method balances the complexity of
   credential distribution with computational efficiency.  While
   symmetric key distribution is more complex than asymmetric
   approaches, PSK authentication offers greater computational
   efficiency compared to the methods outlined in [RFC9528].  The PSK
   method retains mutual authentication, asymmetric ephemeral key
   exchange, and identity protection established by [RFC9528].

   EDHOC with PSK authentication benefits use cases where two nodes
   share a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) provided out-of-band (external PSK).
   Examples include the Authenticated Key Management Architecture (AKMA)
   in mobile systems or the Peer and Authenticator in Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) systems.  The PSK method enables the
   nodes to perform ephemeral key exchange, achieving Perfect Forward
   Secrecy (PFS).  This ensures that even if the PSK is compromised,
   past communications remain secure against active attackers, while
   future communications are protected against passive attackers.
   Additionally, by leveraging the PSK for both authentication and key
   derivation, the method provides quantum-resistant key exchange and
   authentication even when used with ECDHE.

   Another important use case of PSK authentication in the EDHOC
   protocol is session resumption.  This allows previously connected
   parties to quickly reestablish secure communication using pre-shared
   keys from a prior session, reducing the overhead associated with key
   exchange and asymmetric authentication.  By using PSK authentication,
   EDHOC allows session keys to be refreshed with significantly lower
   computational overhead compared to public-key authentication.  In
   this case, the resumption PSK is provisioned after the establishment
   of a previous EDHOC session by using EDHOC_Exporter.  Thus, the
   external PSK serves as a long-term credential while the resumption
   PSK acts as a session key.

   Section 3 provides an overview of the PSK method flow and
   credentials.  Section 4 outlines the changes to key derivation
   compared to [RFC9528].  Section 5 details message formatting and
   processing, and Section 6 describes the usage of PSK for resumption.
   Section 7 defines the use of EDHOC-PSK with OSCORE.  Security
   considerations are described in Section 8, and Section 9 outlines the
   IANA considerations.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in EDHOC [RFC9528], CBOR [RFC8949], CBOR Sequences
   [RFC8742], COSE Structures and Processing [RFC9052], COSE Algorithms
   [RFC9053], CWT and CCS [RFC8392], and the Concise Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [RFC8610], which is used to express CBOR data
   structures.

3.  Protocol

   This document specifies a new EDHOC authentication method (see
   Section 3.2 of [RFC9528]) referred to as the Pre-Shared Key method
   (EDHOC-PSK).  This method shares some features with, and differs in
   other respects from, the authentication methods previously defined in
   EDHOC.

   Authentication is based on a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) shared between the
   Initiator and the Responder.  As in the methods defined in [RFC9528],
   CRED_I and CRED_R are authentication credentials containing
   identifying information for the Initiator and Responder,
   respectively.  However, unlike those methods, there is a single
   shared authentication credential identifier, ID_CRED_PSK, which the
   Responder uses to retrieve the PSK and the associated authentication
   credentials.

3.1.  Credentials

   The Initiator and Responder are assumed to share a PSK (either an
   external PSK or a resumption PSK) with high entropy that meets the
   following requirements:

   *  Only the Initiator and the Responder have access to the PSK.

   *  The Responder can retrieve the PSK, CRED_I, and CRED_R, using
      ID_CRED_PSK.

3.1.1.  ID_CRED_PSK

   ID_CRED_PSK is a COSE header map containing header parameters that
   can identify a pre-shared key.  For example:

   ID_CRED_PSK = {4 : h'0f' }; 4 = 'kid'

   The purpose of ID_CRED_PSK is to facilitate retrieval of the correct
   PSK.  While ID_CRED_PSK use encoding and representation patterns from
   [RFC9528], it differs fundamentally in that it identifies a symmetric
   key rather than a public authentication key.

   It is RECOMMENDED that ID_CRED_PSK uniquely or stochastically
   identifies the corresponding PSK.  Uniqueness avoids ambiguity that
   could require the recipient to try multiple keys, while stochasticity
   reduces the risk of identifier collisions and supports stateless
   processing.  These properties align with the requirements for rKID in
   session resumption.

3.1.2.  CRED_I and CRED_R

   CRED_I and CRED_R are authentication credentials associated with the
   PSK.  The notation CRED_x refers to either CRED_I or CRED_R.
   Authentication is achieved implicitly through the successful use of
   the PSK to derive keying material, and to encrypt and subsequently
   decrypt protected messages.

   When using an external PSK, a common representation of CRED_I and
   CRED_R is a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392],
   where the 'cnf' claim includes the confirmation method COSE_Key.  An
   example of CRED_I and CRED_R is shown below:

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "42-50-31-FF-EF-37-32-39",                /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'0f',                               /kid/
       }
     }
   }

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "23-11-58-AA-B3-7F-10",                   /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'0f',                               /kid/
       }
     }
   }

   Alternative formats for CRED_I and CRED_R MAY be used.  When a
   resumption PSK is employed, CRED_I and CRED_R MUST be the same
   credentials used in the initial EDHOC exchange, for example, public-
   key credentials such as X.509 certificates.

   Implementations MUST ensure that CRED_I and CRED_R are distinct, for
   example by including different identities in their sub-claims (e.g.,
   "42-50-31-FF-EF-37-32-39" and "23-11-58-AA-B3-7F-10").  Ensuring
   distinct credentials simplifies correct party identification and
   prevents reflection and misbinding attacks, as described in
   Appendix D.2 of [RFC9528].

3.1.3.  Encoding and processing guidelines

   The following guidelines apply to the encoding and handling of CRED_x
   and ID_CRED_PSK.  Requirements on CRED_x applies both to CRED_I and
   to CRED_R.

   *  If CRED_x is CBOR-encoded, it SHOULD use deterministic encoding as
      specified in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. of [RFC8949].
      Deterministic encoding ensures consistent identification and
      avoids interoperability issues caused by non-deterministic CBOR
      variants.

   *  If CRED_x is provisioned out-of-band and transported by value, it
      SHOULD be used as received without re-encoding.  Re-encoding can
      cause mismatches when comparing identifiers such as hash values or
      'kid' references.

   *  ID_CRED_PSK SHOULD uniquely identify the corresponding PSK to
      avoid ambiguity.  When ID_CRED_PSK contains a key identifier, care
      must be taken to ensure that 'kid' is unique for the PSK.

   *  When ID_CRED_PSK consists solely of a 'kid' parameter (i.e., { 4 :
      kid }), the compact encoding optimization defined in
      Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528] MUST be applied in plaintext fields
      (such as PLAINTEXT_3A).  For example:

      -  { 4 : h'0f' } encoded as h'0f' (CBOR byte string)

      -  { 4 : 21 } encoded as 0x15 (CBOR integer)

   These optimizations MUST NOT be applied in COSE header parameters or
   in other contexts where the full map structure is required.

   *  To mitigate misbinding attacks, identity information such as a
      'sub' (subject) claim MUST be included in both CRED_I and CRED_R.

3.2.  Message Flow of EDHOC-PSK

   The message flow of EDHOC-PSK follows the structure defined in
   [RFC9528], with authentication based on symmetric keys rather than
   public keys.  For identity protection, credential-related message
   fields appear first in message_3.

   ID_CRED_PSK is encrypted using a key derived from a shared secret
   obtained through the first two messages.  If Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange is used, G_X and G_Y are the ephemeral public keys, and the
   shared secret G_XY is the DH shared secret, as in [RFC9528].  If the
   Diffie-Hellman procedure is replaced by a KEM, then G_X and G_Y are
   encapsulation key and ciphertext, respectively, and the shared secret
   G_XY is derived by the KEM, see [I-D.spm-lake-pqsuites].

   The Responder authenticates the Initiator first.  Figure 1
   illustrates the message flow of the EDHOC-PSK authentication method.

   Initiator                                                   Responder

   |                      G_Y, Enc( C_R, EAD_2 )                       |

              Figure 1: Overview of Message Flow of EDHOC-PSK.

   This approach provides identity protection against passive attackers
   for both Initiator and Responder.  EDHOC message_4 remains OPTIONAL,
   but is needed to authenticate the Responder and achieve mutual
   authentication in EDHOC when external applications (e.g., OSCORE) are
   not relied upon.  In either case, the inclusion of a fourth message
   provides mutual authentication and explicit key confirmation (see
   Section 5.4).

4.  Key Derivation

   The pseudorandom keys (PRKs) used in the EDHOC-PSK authentication
   method are derived with EDHOC_Extract, as in [RFC9528].

   PRK  = EDHOC_Extract( salt, IKM )

   where salt and input keying material (IKM) are defined for each key.
   The definition of EDHOC_Extract depends on the EDHOC hash algorithm
   selected in the cipher suite, see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC9528].

   To maintain a uniform key schedule across all EDHOC authentication
   methods, the same pseudorandom key notation (PRK_2e, PRK_3e2m, and
   PRK_4e3m) is retained.  The index notation is preserved for
   consistency with other EDHOC authentication variants, even though it
   does not fully reflect the functional role of the keys in this
   method; for example, no MACs are used in EDHOC-PSK.

   PRK_2e is extracted as in [RFC9528] with

   *  salt = TH_2, and

   *  IKM = G_XY,

   where the transcript hash TH_2 = H( G_Y, H(message_1) ) is defined in
   Section 5.3.2 of [RFC9528].

   SALT_4e3m is derived from PRK_3e2m and TH_3, as shown in Figure 6 of
   [RFC9528].

   The other PRKs and transcript hashes are modified as specified below.
   Figure 2 lists the key derivations that differ from Section 4.1.2 of
   [RFC9528].

    PRK_3e2m     = PRK_2e
    KEYSTREAM_2A = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_2e,   0, TH_2,  plaintext_length_2a )
    PRK_4e3m     = EDHOC_Extract( SALT_4e3m, PSK )
    KEYSTREAM_3A = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m, 12, TH_3, plaintext_length_3a )
    K_3          = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 3, TH_3, key_length )
    IV_3         = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 4, TH_3, iv_length )

                   Figure 2: Key Derivation of EDHOC-PSK.

   where:

   *  KEYSTREAM_2A is used to encrypt PLAINTEXT_2A in message_2.

      -  plaintext_length_2a is the length of PLAINTEXT_2A in message_2.

   *  KEYSTREAM_3A is used to encrypt PLAINTEXT_3A (the concatenation of
      ID_CRED_PSK and CIPHERTEXT_3B) in message_3.

      -  plaintext_length_3a is the length of PLAINTEXT_3A in message_3.

   *  TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2A ).

   The definition of the transcript hash TH_4 is modified as follows:

   *  TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3B, CRED_I, CRED_R )

5.  Message Formatting and Processing

   This section specifies the differences in message formatting and
   processing compared to Section 5 of [RFC9528].  Note that if any
   processing step fails, then the Responder MUST send an EDHOC error
   message back as defined in Section 6 of [RFC9528], and the EDHOC
   session MUST be aborted.

5.1.  Message 1

   Message 1 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC9528].

5.2.  Message 2

5.2.1.  Formatting of Message 2

   Message 2 is formatted as specified in Section 5.3.1 of [RFC9528].

5.2.2.  Responder Composition of Message 2

   CIPHERTEXT_2A is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
   using a keystream generated with EDHOC_Expand, and the following
   plaintext:

   *  PLAINTEXT_2A = ( C_R, ? EAD_2 )

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2A = PLAINTEXT_2A XOR KEYSTREAM_2A

   C_R, EAD_2 are defined in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC9528].  In contrast to
   [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R, MAC_2, and Signature_or_MAC_2 are not included
   in message_2.  This omission is the primary difference from the
   signature- and MAC-based authentication methods defined in [RFC9528],
   as authentication in EDHOC-PSK relies solely on the shared PSK and
   the successful decryption of protected messages.  KEYSTREAM_2A is
   defined in Section 4.

5.2.3.  Initiator Processing of Message 2

   Upon receiving message_2, the Initiator processes it as follows:

   *  Compute KEYSTREAM_2A as defined in Section 4.

   *  Decrypt CIPHERTEXT_2A using binary XOR, i.e., PLAINTEXT_2A =
      CIPHERTEXT_2A XOR KEYSTREAM_2A

   In contrast to Section 5.3.3 of [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R is not made
   available to the application in step 4, and steps 5 and 6 are skipped

5.3.  Message 3

5.3.1.  Formatting of Message 3

   Message 3 is formatted as specified in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC9528].

5.3.2.  Initiator Composition of Message 3

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3A is computed using a binary additive stream cipher
      with a keystream generated by EDHOC_Expand, applied to the
      following plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK / bstr / -24..23, CIPHERTEXT_3B )

         o  If ID_CRED_PSK contains a single 'kid' parameter, i.e.,
            ID_CRED_PSK = { 4 : kid_PSK }, then the compact encoding is
            applied, see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].

         o  For the case of plaintext_length exceeding the EDHOC_KDF
            output size, see Appendix G of [RFC9528].

      -  Compute KEYSTREAM_3A as in Section 4.

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3A = PLAINTEXT_3A XOR KEYSTREAM_3A

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3B is the 'ciphertext' of COSE_Encrypt0 object as
      defined in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of [RFC9528], with the
      EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher suite, using the
      encryption key K_3, the initialization vector IV_3 (if used by the
      AEAD algorithm), the parameters described in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC9528], plaintext PLAINTEXT_3B and the following parameters as
      input:

      -  protected = h''

      -  external_aad = << ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_I, CRED_R >>

      -  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4

      -  PLAINTEXT_3B = ( ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 as defined in Section 4.

   There is no need for MAC_3 or signature, since AEAD's built-in
   integrity and the use of PSK-based key derivation provides implicit
   authentication of the Initiator.

5.3.3.  Responder Processing of Message 3

   Upon receiving message_3, the Responder proceeds as follows:

   *  Derive K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4.

   *  Parse the structure of message_3, which consists of a stream-
      cipher encrypted structure, CIPHERTEXT_3A = PLAINTEXT_3A XOR
      KEYSTREAM_3A, where PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK, CIPHERTEXT_3B )
      and CIPHERTEXT_3B is the inner AEAD-encrypted object.

   *  Generate KEYSTREAM_3A with the same method the initiator used.

   *  Decrypt CIPHERTEXT_3A using binary XOR with KEYSTREAM_3A to
      recover PLAINTEXT_3A.

   *  Use ID_CRED_PSK to identify the authentication credentials and
      retrieve PSK.

   *  AEAD-decrypt CIPHERTEXT_3B using:

      -  K_3, IV_3

      -  external_aad = << ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_I, CRED_R >>

      -  protected = h''

      -  AEAD algorithm from cipher suite

   If AEAD verification fails, this indicates a processing problem or
   that the message was tampered with.  If it succeeds, the Responder
   concludes that the Initiator possesses the PSK, correctly derived
   TH_3, and is actively participating in the protocol.

   Finally, the Responder computes TH_4 as defined in Section 4.

   No MAC_3 or signature is needed, as the AEAD tag guarantees both
   integrity and authenticity in this symmetric setting.

5.4.  Message 4

   Message 4 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.5 of
   [RFC9528].

   After successfully verifying message_4, or another fourth message
   from the Responder protected with an exported application key such as
   an OSCORE message, the Initiator is assured that the Responder has
   derived PRK_out (key confirmation) and that no other party can derive
   this key.

   The Initiator MUST NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until it has successfully verified such a fourth message and the
   application has authenticated the Responder.

   Compared to [RFC9528], the fourth message not only provides key
   confirmation but also authenticates the Responder.  For mutual
   authentication a fourth message is therefore mandatory.

6.  PSK usage for Session Resumption

   This section specifies how EDHOC-PSK is used for session resumption
   in EDHOC.  The EDHOC_Exporter, as defined in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC9528], is used to derive the resumption parameters rPSK and rKID:

     rPSK         = EDHOC_Exporter( TBD2, h'', resumption_psk_length )
     rKID         = EDHOC_Exporter( TBD3, h'', id_cred_psk_length )
     rID_CRED_PSK = { 4 : rKID }

                      Figure 3: Resumption Parameters.

   where:

   *  resumption_psk_length defaults to the key_length, i.e., the length
      of the encryption key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in the selected
      cipher suite of the session where the EDHOC_Exporter is invoked.

   *  id_cred_psk_length defaults to 2 bytes.

   A peer that has successfully completed an EDHOC session, regardless
   of the authentication method used or whether the session was a PSK
   resumption, MUST generate a resumption key for the next resumption
   within the current "session series", provided that PSK resumption is
   supported.

   To ensure both peers share the same resumption key, when a resumption
   session is run using rPSK_i as the resumption key:

   *  The Responder MAY delete the previous resumption key rPSK_(i-1),
      if present, after successfully verifying message_3.  At that point
      the Responder can be certain that the Initiator has access to the
      current resumption key rPSK_i.

   *  The Initiator MAY delete rPSK_i after successfully verifying the
      fourth message.  At that point, the Initiator can be certain that
      the Responder already has derived the next resumption key,
      rPSK_(i+1).

   *  The Responder MAY delete rPSK_i after successfully verifying a
      fifth message from the Initiator protected with an exported
      application key such as an OSCORE message, if present.  At that
      point, the Initiator can be certain that the Responder already has
      derived the next resumption key, rPSK_(i+1).

6.1.  Cipher Suite Requirements for Resumption

   When using a resumption PSK derived from a previous EDHOC exchange:

   1.  The resumption PSK MUST only be used with the same cipher suite
       from which it was derived, or with a cipher suite that provides
       stronger security guarantees.

   2.  Implementations MUST maintain a mapping between each resumption
       PSK and its originating cipher suite to enforce this requirement.

   3.  If a resumption PSK is offered with a cipher suite that provides
       weaker security, the Responder MUST reject the ongoing EDHOC
       session.

6.2.  Privacy Considerations for Resumption

   When using resumption PSKs:

   *  ID_CRED_PSK is not exposed to passive attackers, and under normal
      operation it is not reused.  Reuse of the same ID_CRED_PSK can
      occur due to transmission errors or when a peer loses its stored
      resumption key.  An active attacker can obtain the value of
      ID_CRED_PSK and force its reuse.  This aligns with the security
      goals of EDHOC-PSK, which are to provide identity protection
      against passive attackers, but not against active attackers.

6.3.  Security Considerations for Resumption

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST NOT be used for purposes other than EDHOC
      session resumption.

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST be securely stored with the same level of
      protection as the session keys.

   *  Parties SHOULD prevent excessive reuse of the same resumption PSK.

7.  EDHOC-PSK and OSCORE

   Before sending message_3 the Initiator can derive PRK_out and create
   an OSCORE-protected request.  The request payload MAY convey both an
   EDHOC message_3 and OSCORE-protected data combined together, as
   described in Section 3 of [RFC9668].

8.  Security Considerations

   The EDHOC-PSK authentication method introduces deviations from the
   initial specification of EDHOC [RFC9528].  This section analyzes the
   security implications of these changes.

8.1.  Identity Protection

   In EDHOC-PSK, ID_CRED_PSK in message_3 is encrypted with a keystream
   derived from the ephemeral shared secret G_XY.  As a result, unlike
   the asymmetric authentication methods in Section 9.1 of [RFC9528],
   which protect the Initiator’s identity against active attackers and
   the Responder’s identity against passive attackers, EDHOC-PSK
   protects both the Initiator and the Responder identities against
   passive attackers.

8.2.  Mutual Authentication

   EDHOC-PSK provides mutual authentication and explicit key
   confirmation through an additional message that demonstrates
   possession of the PSK.  This may be the optional message_4 or an
   application message (e.g., an OSCORE message) protected with a key
   derived from EDHOC.

   To mitigate reflection or Selfie attacks, the identities in CRED_I
   and CRED_R MUST be distinct.

8.3.  Protection of External Authorization Data (EAD)

   As in [RFC9528], EDHOC-PSK ensures the confidentiality and integrity
   of External Authorization Data (EAD).  The security guarantees for
   EAD fields remain unchanged from the original EDHOC specification.

8.4.  Post Quantum Considerations

   Advances in quantum computing suggest that a Cryptographically
   Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) may eventually be realized.  Such a
   machine would render many asymmetric algorithms, including Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), insecure.

   EDHOC-PSK derives authentication and session keys primarily from a
   symmetric PSK, which provides quantum resistance even when combined
   with ECDHE.  However, if a CRQC is realized, the ECDHE contribution
   degenerates to providing only randomness.  In that case, EDHOC-PSK
   with ECDHE offers neither identity protection nor Perfect Forward
   Secrecy (PFS) against quantum adversaries.  Moreover, if the PSK is
   compromised, a passive quantum attacker could decrypt both past and
   future sessions.

   By contrast, combining EDHOC-PSK with a quantum-resistant Key
   Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), such as ML-KEM, ensures both identity
   protection and PFS even against quantum-capable attackers.  Future
   EDHOC cipher suites incorporating ML-KEM are expected to be
   registered; see [I-D.spm-lake-pqsuites].

8.5.  Independence of Session Keys

   NIST requires that an ephemeral private key be used in only one key-
   establishment transaction ([SP-800-56A], Section 5.6.3.3).  This
   requirement preserves session key independence and forward secrecy,
   and EDHOC-PSK complies with it.

   In other protocols, reuse of ephemeral keys, especially when combined
   with missing public key validation, has led to severe
   vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to recover “ephemeral” private
   keys and compromise both past and future sessions between two
   legitimate parties.  Assuming breach and minimizing the impact of
   compromise are fundamental principles of zero-trust security.

8.6.  Unified Approach and Recommendations

   For use cases where application data is transmitted, it can be sent
   together with message_3, maintaining efficiency.  In applications
   such as EAP-EDHOC, where no application data is exchanged, message_4
   is mandatory.  In such cases, EDHOC-PSK does not increase the total
   number of messages.  Other implementations may replace message_4 with
   an OSCORE-protected message.  In this case, the following requirement
   applies: The Initiator SHALL NOT persistently store PRK_out or
   derived application keys until successfully verifying message_4 or a
   message protected with an exported application key (e.g., an OSCORE
   message).  This ensures that key material is stored only after its
   authenticity is confirmed, thereby strengthening privacy by
   preventing premature storage of potentially compromised keys.
   Finally, the order of authentication (i.e., whether the Initiator or
   the Responder authenticates first) is not relevant in EDHOC-PSK.
   While this ordering affects privacy properties in the asymmetric
   methods of [RFC9528], it has no significant impact in EDHOC-PSK.

   message_3 (CBOR Sequence) (11 bytes)
   4A B3 28 3A B8 50 BB 4C FB 46 68

   The transcript hash TH_4 is calculated using the EDHOC hash
   algorithm: TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3, CRED_I, CRED_R )

   TH_4 (CBOR Data Item) (32 bytes)
   11 48 1B 9A FE F9 5C 67 9A 52 03 82 17 EE DD 0E
