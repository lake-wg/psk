             EDHOC Authenticated with Pre-Shred Keys (PSK)
                    draft-ietf-lake-edhoc-psk-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication method
   for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key exchange
   protocol.  The PSK method enhances computational efficiency while
   providing mutual authentication, ephemeral key exchange, identity
   protection, and quantum resistance.  It is particularly suited for
   systems where nodes share a PSK provided out-of-band (external PSK)
   and enables efficient session resumption with less computational
   overhead when the PSK is provided from a previous EDHOC session
   (resumption PSK).  This document details the PSK method flow, key
   derivation changes, message formatting, processing, and security
   considerations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication method
   for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key exchange
   protocol [RFC9528].  The PSK method balances the complexity of
   credential distribution with computational efficiency.  While
   symmetrical key distribution is more complex than asymmetrical
   approaches, PSK authentication offers greater computational
   efficiency compared to the methods outlined in [RFC9528].  The PSK
   method retains mutual authentication, asymmetric ephemeral key
   exchange, and identity protection established by [RFC9528].

   EDHOC with PSK authentication benefits systems where two nodes nodes
   share a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) provided out-of-band (external PSK).
   This applies to scenarios like the Authenticated Key Management
   Architecture (AKMA) in mobile systems or the Peer and Authenticator
   in Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) systems.  The PSK method
   enables the nodes to perform ephemeral key exchange, achieving
   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).  This ensures that even if the PSK is
   compromised, past communications remain secure against active
   attackers, while future communications are protected from passive
   attackers.  Additionally, by leveraging the PSK for both
   authentication and key derivation, the method offers quantum
   resistance key exchange and authentication.

   Another key use case of PSK authentication in the EDHOC protocol is
   session resumption.  This enables previously connected parties to
   quickly reestablish secure communication using pre-shared keys from a
   prior session, reducing the overhead associated with key exchange and
   asymmetric authentication.  By using PSK authentication, EDHOC allows
   session keys to be refreshed with significantly lower computational
   overhead compared to public-key authentication.  In this case, the
   PSK is provisioned after the establishment of a previous EDHOC
   session by using EDHOC_Exporter (resumption PSK).

   Therefore, the external PSK is supposed to be a long-term credential
   while the resumption PSK is a session key.

   Section 3 provides an overview of the PSK method flow and
   credentials.  Section 4 outlines the changes to key derivation
   compared to [RFC9528], Section 5 details message formatting and
   processing, and Section 6 discusses security considerations.  How to
   derive keys for resumption is described in Section 7.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in EDHOC [RFC9528], CBOR [RFC8949], CBOR Sequences
   [RFC8742], COSE Structures and Processing [RFC9052], COSE Algorithms
   [RFC9053], CWT and CCS [RFC8392], and the Concise Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [RFC8610], which is used to express CBOR data
   structures.

3.  Protocol

   In this method, the Pre-Shared Key identifier (ID_CRED_PSK) is sent
   in message_3.  The ID_CRED_PSK allows retrieval of CRED_PSK, a
   COSE_Key compatible authentication credential that contains the PSK.
   Through this document we will refer to the Pre-Shared Key
   authentication method as EDHOC-PSK.

3.1.  Credentials

   Initiator and Responder are assumed to have a PSK (external PSK or
   resumption PSK) with good amount of randomness and the requirements
   that:

   *  Only the Initiator and the Responder have access to the PSK.

   *  The Responder is able to retrieve the PSK using ID_CRED_PSK.

   where:

   *  ID_CRED_PSK is a COSE header map containing header parameters that
      can identify a pre-shared key.  For example:

   ID_CRED_PSK = {4 : h'0f' }

   *  CRED_PSK is a COSE_Key compatible authentication credential, i.e.,
      a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392] whose
      'cnf' claim uses the confirmation method 'COSE_Key' encoding the
      PSK.  For example:

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "mydotbot",                               /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'0f',                               /kid/
         -1 : h'50930FF462A77A3540CF546325DEA214'  /k/
       }
     }
   }

   The purpose of ID_CRED_PSK is to facilitate the retrieval of the PSK.
   It is RECOMMENDED that it uniquely identifies the CRED_PSK as the
   recipient might otherwise have to try several keys.  If ID_CRED_PSK
   contains a single 'kid' parameter, then the compact encoding is
   applied; see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].  The authentication
   credential CRED_PSK substitutes CRED_I and CRED_R specified in
   [RFC9528], and, when applicable, MUST follow the same guidelines
   described in Section 3.5.2 and Section 3.5.3 of [RFC9528].

3.2.  Message Flow of PSK

   The ID_CRED_PSK is sent in message_3, encrypted using a key derived
   from the ephemeral shared secret, G_XY.  The Responder authenticates
   the Initiator first.  Figure 1 shows the message flow of PSK
   authentication method.

   Initiator                                                   Responder
   |                  METHOD, SUITES_I, G_X, C_I, EAD_1                |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------>|
   |                             message_1                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                      G_Y, Enc( C_R, EAD_2 )                       |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_2                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                   Enc( ID_CRED_PSK, AEAD( EAD_3 ) )               |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------>|
   |                             message_3                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                           AEAD( EAD_4 )                           |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_4                             |

                 Figure 1: Overview of Message Flow of PSK.

   This approach provides protection against passive attackers for both
   Initiator and Responder. message_4 remains optional, but is needed to
   authenticate the Responder and achieve mutual authentication in EDHOC
   if not relaying on external applications, such as OSCORE.  With this
   fourth message, the protocol achieves both explicit key confirmation
   and mutual authentication.

4.  Key Derivation

   The pseudorandom keys (PRKs) used for PSK authentication method in
   EDHOC are derived using EDHOC_Extract, as done in [RFC9528].

   PRK  = EDHOC_Extract( salt, IKM )

   where the salt and input keying material (IKM) are defined for each
   key.  The definition of EDHOC_Extract depends on the EDHOC hash
   algorithm selected in the cipher suite.

   Figure 2 lists the key derivations that differ from those specified
   in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528].

     PRK_3e2m    = PRK_2e
     PRK_4e3m    = EDHOC_Extract( SALT_4e3m, CRED_PSK )
     KEYSTREAM_3 = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m, 11, TH_3, plaintext_length_3 )
     K_3         = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 12, TH_3, key_length )
     IV_3        = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 13, TH_3, iv_length )

        Figure 2: Key Derivation of EDHOC PSK Authentication Method.

   where:

   *  KEYSTREAM_3 is used to encrypt the ID_CRED_PSK in message_3.

   *  TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2 )

   Additionally, the definition of the transcript hash TH_4 is modified
   as:

   *  TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3, CRED_PSK )

5.  Message Formatting and Processing

   This section specifies the differences in message formatting and
   processing compared to Section 5 of [RFC9528].

5.1.  Message 1

   Message 1 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC9528].

5.2.  Message 2

5.2.1.  Formatting of Message 2

   Message 2 is formatted as specified in Section 5.3.1 of [RFC9528].

5.2.2.  Responder Composition of Message 2

   CIPHERTEXT_2 is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
   using a keystream generated with EDHOC_Expand, and the following
   plaintext:

   *  PLAINTEXT_2B = ( C_R, ? EAD_2 )

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2 = PLAINTEXT_2B XOR KEYSTREAM_2

   Contrary to [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R, MAC_2, and Signature_or_MAC_2 are
   not used.  C_R, EAD_2, and KEYSTREAM_2 are defined in Section 5.3.2
   of [RFC9528].

5.2.3.  Initiator Processing of Message 2

   Compared to Section 5.3.3 of [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R is not made
   available to the application in step 4, and steps 5 and 6 are skipped

5.3.  Message 3

5.3.1.  Formatting of Message 3

   Message 3 is formatted as specified in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC9528].

5.3.2.  Initiator Composition of Message 3

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3 is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
      using a keystream generated with EDHOC_Expand, and the following
      plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK / bstr / -24..23, CIPHERTEXT_3B )

         o  If ID_CRED_PSK contains a single 'kid' parameter, i.e.,
            ID_CRED_PSK = { 4 : kid_PSK }, then the compact encoding is
            applied, see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].

      -  Compute KEYSTREAM_3 as in Section 4, where plaintext_length is
         the length of PLAINTEXT_3A.  For the case of plaintext_length
         exceeding the EDHOC_KDF output size, see Appendix G of
         [RFC9528].

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3 = PLAINTEXT_3A XOR KEYSTREAM_3

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3B is the 'ciphertext' of COSE_Encrypt0 object as
      defined in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of [RFC9528], with the
      EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher suite, using the
      encryption key K_3, the initialization vector IV_3 (if used by the
      AEAD algorithm), the parameters described in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC9528], plaintext PLAINTEXT_3B and the following parameters as
      input:

      -  protected = h''

      -  external_aad = << ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_PSK >>

      -  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4

      -  PLAINTEXT_3B = ( ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3B,
   CRED_PSK ), defined in Section 4.

5.3.3.  Responder Processing of Message 3

5.4.  Message 4

   Message 4 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.5 of
   [RFC9528].

   Compared to [RFC9528], a fourth message does not only provide key
   confirmation but also Responder authentication.  To authenticate the
   Responder and achieve mutual authentication, a fourth message is
   mandatory.

   After verifying message_4, the Initiator is assured that the
   Responder has calculated the key PRK_out (key confirmation) and that
   no other party can derive the key.  The Initiator MUST NOT
   persistently store PRK_out or application keys until the Initiator
   has verified message_4 or a message protected with a derived
   application key, such as an OSCORE message, from the Responder and
   the application has authenticated the Responder.

6.  Security Considerations

   PSK authentication method introduces changes with respect to the
   current specification of EDHOC [RFC9528].  This section analyzes the
   security implications of these changes.

6.1.  Identity protection

   EDHOC-PSK encrypts ID_CRED_PSK in message 3, XOR encrypted with a
   keystream derived from the ephemeral shared secret G_XY.  As a
   consequence, contrary to the current EDHOC methods that protect the
   Initiator’s identity against active attackers and the Responder’s
   identity against passive attackers (See Section 9.1 of RFC9528
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9528.html#section-9.1)), EDHOC-PSK
   provides identity protection for both the Initator and the Responder
   against passive attackers.

6.2.  Mutual Authentication

   Authentication in EDHOC-PSK depends on the security of the session
   key and the protocol's confidentiality.  Both security properties
   hold as long as the PSK remains secret.  Even though the foruth
   message (message_4) remains optional, mutual authentication is not
   guaranteed without it, or without an OSCORE message or any
   application data that confirms that the Responder owns the PSK.  When
   message_4 is included, the protocol achieves explicit key
   confirmation in addition to mutual authentication.

6.3.  External Authorization Data Protection

   Similarly to [RFC9528], EDHOC-PSK provides external authorization
   data protection.  The integrity and confidentiality of EAD fields
   follow the same security guarantees as in the original EDHOC
   specification.

6.4.  Post Quantum Considerations

   Recent achievements in developing quantum computers demonstrate that
   it is probably feasible to build one that is cryptographically
   significant.  If such a computer is implemented, many of the
   cryptographic algorithms and protocols currently in use would be
   insecure.  A quantum computer would be able to solve Diffie-Hellman
   (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) problems in polynomial
   time.

   EDCHOC with pre-shared keys would not be vulnerable to quantum
   attacks because those keys are used as inputs to the key derivation
   function.  The use of intermediate keys derived through key
   derivation functions ensure that the message is not immediately
   compromised if the symmetrically distributed key (PSK) is
   compromised, or if the algorithm used to distribute keys
   asymmetrically (DH) is broken.  If the pre-shared key has sufficient
   entropy and the Key Derivation Function (KDF), encryption, and
   authentication transforms are quantum secure, then the resulting
   system is believed to be quantum secure.  Therefore, provided that
   the PSK remains secret, EDHOC-PSK provides confidentiality, mutual
   authentication and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) even in the presence
   of quantum attacks.  What is more, the key exchange is still a key
   agreement where both parties contribute with randomness.

6.5.  Independence of Session Keys

   NIST mandates that that an ephemeral private key shall be used in
   exactly one key-establishment transaction (see Section 5.6.3.3 of
   [SP-800-56A]).  This requirement is essential for preserving session
   key independence and ensuring forward secrecy.  The EDHOC protocol
   complies with this NIST requirement.

   In other protocols, the reuse of ephemeral keys, particularly when
   combined with implementation flaws such as the absence of public key
   validation, has resulted in critical security vulnerabilities.  Such
   weaknesses have allowed attackers to recover the so called
   “ephemeral” private key from a compromised session, thereby enabling
   them to compromise the security of both past and future sessions
   between legitimate parties.  Assuming breach and minimizing the
   impact of compromise are fundamental zero-trust principles.

6.6.  Unified Approach and Recommendations

   For use cases involving the transmission of application data,
   application data can be sent concurrently with message_3, maintaining
   the protocol's efficiency.  In applications such as EAP-EDHOC, where
   application data is not sent, message_4 is mandatory.  Thus, EDHOC-
   PSK authentication method does not include any extra messages.  Other
   implementations may continue using OSCORE in place of EDHOC
   message_4, with a required change in the protocol's language to: The
   Initiator SHALL NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until the Initiator has verified message_4 or a message protected
   with a derived application key, such as an OSCORE message.

   This change ensures that key materials are only stored once their
   integrity and authenticity are confirmed, thereby enhancing privacy
   by preventing early storage of potentially compromised keys.

   Lastly, whether the Initiator or Responder authenticates first is not
   relevant when using symmetric keys.  This consideration was important
   for the privacy properties when using asymmetric authentication but
   is not significant in the context of symmetric key usage.

7.  PSK usage for Session Resumtpion

   This section defines how PSKs are used for session resumption in
   EDHOC.  Each time EDHOC-PSK is run a new PRK_out and PRK_exporter
   will be generated.  Following Section 4.2 of RFC9528
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9528.html#section-4.2),
   EDHOC_Exporter can be used to derive both CRED_PSK and ID_CRED_PSK:

   CRED_PSK = EDHOC_Exporter( 2, h'', resumption_psk_length )
   ID_CRED_PSK = EDHOC_Exporter( 3, h'', id_cred_psk_length )

7.1.  Ciphersuite Requirements for Resumption

   When using a resumption PSK derived from a previous EDHOC exchange:

   1.  The resumption PSK MUST only be used with the same ciphersuite
       that was used in the original EDHOC exchange, or with a
       ciphersuite that provides equal or higher security guarantees.

   2.  Implmentations SHOULD manitain a mapping between the resumption
       PSK and its originating ciphersuite to enforce this requirement.

   3.  If a resumption PSK is offered with a weaker ciphersuite than its
       original exchange, the recipient MUST reject the connection
       attempt.

7.2.  Privacy Considerations for Resumption

   When using resumption PSKs:

   *  The same ID_CRED_PSK is reused each time EDHOC is executed with a
      specific resumption PSK.

   *  To prevent long-term tracking, implementations SHOULD periodically
      initiate a full EDHOC exchange to generate a new resumption PSK
      and corresponding ID_CRED_PSK.  Alternatively, as stated in
      Appendix H of RFC9528 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
      rfc9528.html#appendix-h), EDHOC_KeyUpdate can be used to derive a
      new PRK_out, and consequently a new CRED_PSK and ID_CRED_PSK for
      session resumption.

   While PSK reuse enhances efficiency by reducing the overhead of key
   exchanges, it presents privacy risks if not managed properly through
   periodic renewal.

7.3.  Security Considerations for Resumption

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST NOT be used for purposes other than EDHOC
      session resumption.

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST be securely stored with the same level of
      protection as the original session keys.

   *  Parties SHOULD implement mechanisms to detect and prevent
      excessive reuse of the same resumption PSK.
