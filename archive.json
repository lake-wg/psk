This is good from an economy of specification and may be good for a person who is familiar with RFC 9528, which anyway is assumed. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to read when you need to have RFC 9528 open on the side, and it isn't clear which parts of RFC 9528 that are not used. Moreover, since some terms are given a different definition and/or a different interpretation, there is risk for both confusion and potential errors.\n\nFor readability, some parts may not be repeated. This has the drawback when there is a need for update.\n\nWe should not have contradicting CDDL definitions between this spec and RFC 9528.\n\nAlso, the labeling of the parameters becomes confusing when the original meaning is lost, e.g. the \"2m\" part of PRK_3e2m does mean anything when there is no MAC in message 2. \n\nI'm in favor of defining new terms that makes sense for the new protocol, but also indicate what parts carry over directly from RFC 9528. Some overall refactoring is needed to carry out this. \n\n",
