This is good from an economy of specification and may be good for a person who is familiar with RFC 9528, which anyway is assumed. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to read when you need to have RFC 9528 open on the side, and it isn't clear which parts of RFC 9528 that are not used. Moreover, since some terms are given a different definition and/or a different interpretation, there is risk for both confusion and potential errors.\n\nFor readability, some parts may not be repeated. This has the drawback when there is a need for update.\n\nWe should not have contradicting CDDL definitions between this spec and RFC 9528.\n\nAlso, the labeling of the parameters becomes confusing when the original meaning is lost, e.g. the \"2m\" part of PRK_3e2m does mean anything when there is no MAC in message 2. \n\nI'm in favor of defining new terms that makes sense for the new protocol, but also indicate what parts carry over directly from RFC 9528. Some overall refactoring is needed to carry out this. \n\n",

      "body": "Hi all, \nI have identified a potential issue in the calculation of Transcript Hash 3 (TH_3) in the draft specification. TH_3 is defined as follows:\n\n **TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2, CRED_PSK )**\n\nTH_3 is then used to generate KEYSTREAM_3:\n\n **KEYSTREAM_3   = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m,    TBD, TH_3,  ID_CRED_PSK length )**\n\nKEYSTREAM_3 is used by the Initiator to encrypt ID_CRED_PSK before sending it in message_3. Consequently, the Responder needs to derive the same KEYSTREAM_3 to decrypt ID_CRED_PSK when processing message_3.\n\nThe issue is that TH_3 already includes CRED_PSK. However, the Responder requires KEYSTREAM_3 to decrypt ID_CRED_PSK and determine which PSK should be used. This creates a circular dependency:\n \n 1. To derive KEYSTREAM_3, the Responder must first compute TH_3.\n 2. Computing TH_3 requires CRED_PSK, which depends on knowing the correct PSK.\n 3. However, the Responder can only determine the correct PSK after decrypting ID_CRED_PSK using KEYSTREAM_3.",
