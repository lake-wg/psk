1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Pre-shared key (PSK) authentication method provides a balance between
   security and computational efficiency.  This authentication method
   was proposed in the first I-Ds of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE
   (EDHOC) [RFC9528], and was ruled out to speed out the development
   process.  However, there is now a renewed effort to reintroduce PSK
   authentication, making this draft an update to the [RFC9528].

   EDHOC with PSK authentication could be beneficial for existing
   systems where two nodes have been provided with a PSK from other
   parties out of band.  This allows the nodes to perform ephemeral
   Diffie-Hellman to achieve Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensuring
   that past communications remain secure even if the PSK is
   compromised.  The authentication provided by EDHOC prevents
   eavesdropping by on-path attackers, as they would need to be active
   participants in the communication to intercept and potentially tamper
   with the session.  Examples could be Generic Bootstrapping
   Architecture (GBA) and Authenticated Key Management Architecture
   (AKMA) in mobile systems, or Peer and Authenticator in EAP.

   Another prominent use case of PSK authentication in the EDHOC
   protocol is session resumption.  This allows previously connected
   parties to quickly reestablish secure communication using pre-shared
   keys from their earlier session, reducing the overhead of full key
   exchange.  This efficiency is beneficial in scenarios where frequent
   key updates are needed, such in resource-constrained environments or
   applications requiring high-frequency secure communications.  The use
   of PSK authentication in EDHOC ensures that session key can be
   refreshed without heavy computational overhead, typically associated
   with public key operations, thus optimizing both performance and
   security.

1.2.  Assumptions

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol

   In this method, the Pre-Shared Key identifier (ID_CRED_PSK) is sent
   in message_3.  The ID_CRED_PSK allows retrieval of CRED_PSK, a COSE
   object that contains the PSK.  Through this document we will refer to
   the Pre-Shared Key authentication method as EDHOC-PSK.

3.1.  Credentials

   Initiator and Responder are assumed to have a PSK with good amount of
   randomness and the requirements that:

   *  Only the Initiator and the Responder have access to the PSK.

   *  The Responder is able to retrieve the PSK using ID_CRED_PSK.

   where:

   *  ID_CRED_PSK is a COSE header map containing header parameters that
      can identify a pre-shared key.  For example:

   ID_CRED_PSK = {4 : h'lf' }

   *  CRED_PSK is a COSE_Key compatible credential, encoded as a CCS or
      CWT.  For example:

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "mydotbot",                               /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'32',                               /kid/
         -1 : h'50930FF462A77A3540CF546325DEA214'  /k/
       }
     }
   }

   The purpose of ID_CRED_PSK is to facilitate the retrieval of the PSK.
   It is RECOMMENDED that it uniquely identifies the CRED_PSK as the
   recipient might otherwise have to try several keys.  If ID_CRED_PSK
   contains a single 'kid' parameter, then the compact encoding is
   applied; see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].  The authentication
   credential CRED_PSK substitutes CRED_I and CRED_R specified in
   [RFC9529], and, when applicable, MUST follow the same guidelines
   described in Sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 of [RFC9528].

3.2.  Message flow of PSK

   The ID_CRED_PSK is sent in message_3, encrypted using a key derived
   from the ephemeral shared secret, G_XY.  The Responder authenticates
   the Initiator first.  Figure 1 shows the message flow of PSK
   authentication method.

   Initiator                                                   Responder
   |                  METHOD, SUITES_I, G_X, C_I, EAD_1                |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------>|
   |                             message_1                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                      G_Y, Enc( C_R, EAD_2 )                       |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_2                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                   Enc( ID_CRED_PSK ), AEAD( EAD_3 )               |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------>|
   |                             message_3                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                           AEAD( EAD_4 )                           |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_4                             |

                 Figure 1: Overview of message flow of PSK.

   This approach provides protection against passive attackers for both
   Initiator and Responder. message_4 remains optional, but is needed to
   to authenticate the Responder and achieve mutual authentication in
   EDHOC if not relaying on external applications, such as OSCORE.  With
   this fourth message, the protocol achieves both explicit key
   confirmation and mutual authentication.

4.  Key derivation

   The pseudorandom keys (PRKs) used for PSK authentication method in
   EDHOC are derived using EDHOC_Extract, as done in [RFC9528].

   PRK  = EDHOC_Extract( salt, IKM )

   where the salt and input keying material (IKM) are defined for each
   key.  The definition of EDHOC_Extract depends on the EDHOC hash
   algorithm selected in the cipher suite.

   Figure 2 lists the key derivations that differ from those specified
   in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528].

  PRK_3e2m      = PRK_2e
  PRK_4e3m      = EDHOC_Extract( SALT_4e3m, CRED_PSK )
  KEYSTREAM_3   = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m,    TBD,  TH_3,       key_length )
  K_3           = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  TH_3,  key_length )
  IV_3          = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  TH_3,  iv_length  )

       Figure 2: Key derivation of EDHOC PSK authentication method.

   where:

   *  KEYSTREAM_3 is used to encrypt the ID_CRED_PSK in message_3.

   *  TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2, CRED_PSK )

   *  TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3, CRED_PSK )

5.  Message formatting and processing.  Differences with respect to
    [RFC9528]

   This section specifies the differences on the message formatting
   compared to [RFC9528].

5.1.  Message 1

   Same as message_1 of EDHOC, described in Section 5.2.1 of [RFC9528].

5.2.  Message 2

   message_2 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_2 = (
     G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 : bstr,
   )

   where:

   *  G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 is the concatenation of G_Y (i.e., the ephemeral
      public key of the Responder) and CIPHERTEXT_2.

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2 is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
      using KEYSTREAM_2 and the following plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_2 = ( C_R, / bstr / -24..23, ? EAD_2 )

      -  CIPHERTEXT_2 = PLAINTEXT_2 XOR KEYSTREAM_2

   Contrary to [RFC9528], MAC_2 is not used.

5.3.  Message 3

   message_3 SHALL be a CBOR Sequence, as defined below:

   message_3 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_3: bstr,
   )

   where:

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3 is a concatenation of two different ciphertexts:

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3A is bit string calculated with a binary additive
         stream cipher, using a KESYSTREAM_3 generated with EDHOC_Expand
         and the following plaintext:

         o  PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK )

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3B is a COSE_Encrypt0 object as defined in Sections
         5.2 and 5.3 of [RFC9052], with the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the
         selected cipher suite, using the encryption key K_3, the
         initialization vector IV_3 (if used by the AEAD algorithm), the
         parameters described in Section 5.2 of [RFC9528], plaintext
         PLAINTEXT_3B and the following parameters as input:

         o  protected = h''

         o  external_aad = << Enc(ID_CRED_PSK), TH_3 >>

         o  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 5.2

         o  PLAINTEXT_3B = ( ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3,
   CRED_PSK ), defined in Section 5.2.

5.4.  Message 4

   message_4 is mandatory and is a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_4 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_4 : bstr,
   )

   A fourth message is mandatory for Responder's authentication.  The
   Initiator MUST NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until the Initiator has verified message_4 or a message protected
   with a derived application key, such as an OSCORE message, from the
   Responder and the application has authenticated the Responder.

6.  Security Considerations

   When evaluating the security considerations, it is important to
   differentiate between the initial handshake and session resumption
   phases.

   1.  *Initial Handshake*: a fresh CRED_PSK is used to establish a
       secure connection.

   2.  *Session Resumption*: the same PSK identifier (ID_CRED_PSK) is
       reused each time EDHOC is executed.  While this enhances
       efficiency and reduces the overhead of key exchanges, it presents
       privacy risks if not managed properly.  Over multiple resumption
       sessions, initiating a full EDHOC session changes the resumption
       PSK, resulting in a new ID_CRED_PSK.  The periodic renewal of the
       CRED_PSK and ID_CRED_PSK helps mitigate long-term privacy risks
       associated with static key identifiers.

6.1.  Identity protection

   The current EDHOC methods protect the Initiator’s identity against
   active attackers and the Responder’s identity against passive
   attackers (See Section 9.1 of [RFC9528]).  With EDHOC-PSK
   authentication method, both the Initiator's and Responder's
   identities are protected against passive attackers, but not against
   active attackers.

6.2.  Number of messages

   The current EDHOC protocol consists of three mandatory messages and
   an optional fourth message.  In the case of EDHOC-PSK authentication
   method, message_4 remains optional, but mutual authentication is not
   guaranteed without it, or an OSCORE message or any application data
   that confirms that the Responder owns the PSK.  Additionally, with
   this fourth message the protocol achieves explicit key confirmation
   in addition to mutual authentication.

6.3.  External Authorization Data

   The Initiator and Responder can send information in EAD_3 and EAD_4
   or in OSCORE messages in parallel with message_3 and message_4.  This
   is possible because the Initiator knows that only the Responder with
   access to the CRED_PSK can decrypt the information.

6.4.  Attacks

   EDHOC-PSK authentication method offers privacy and resistance to
   passive attacks but might be vulnerable to certain active attacks due
   to delayed authentication.

7.  Privacy Considerations

8.  Unified Approach and Recommendations

   For use cases involving the transmission of application data,
   application data can be sent concurrently with message_3, maintaining
   the protocol's efficiency.  In applications such as EAP-EDHOC, where
   application data is not sent, message_4 is mandatory.  Thus, EDHOC-
   PSK authentication method doe snot include any extra messages.  Other
   implementations may continue using OSCORE in place of EDHOC
   message_4, with a required change in the protocol's language to: The
   Initiator SHALL NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until the Initiator has verified message_4 or a message protected
   with a derived application key, such as an OSCORE message.

   This change ensures that key materials are only stored once their
   integrity and authenticity are confirmed, thereby enhancing privacy
   by preventing early storage of potentially compromised keys.

   Lastly, whether the Initiator or Responder authenticates first is not
   relevant when using symmetric keys.  This consideration was important
   for the privacy properties when using asymmetric authentication but
   is not significant in the context of symmetric key usage.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
