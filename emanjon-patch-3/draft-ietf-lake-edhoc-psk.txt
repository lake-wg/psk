             EDHOC Authenticated with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
                    draft-ietf-lake-edhoc-psk-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication method
   for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key exchange
   protocol.  The PSK method enhances computational efficiency while
   providing mutual authentication, ephemeral key exchange, identity
   protection, and quantum resistance.  It is particularly suited for
   systems where nodes share a PSK provided out-of-band (external PSK)
   and enables efficient session resumption with less computational
   overhead when the PSK is provided from a previous EDHOC session
   (resumption PSK).  This document details the PSK method flow, key
   derivation changes, message formatting, processing, and security
   considerations.

1.  Introduction

   method for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) key
   exchange protocol [RFC9528].  The PSK method balances the complexity
   of credential distribution with computational efficiency.  While
   symmetrical key distribution is more complex than asymmetrical
   approaches, PSK authentication offers greater computational
   efficiency compared to the methods outlined in [RFC9528].  The PSK
   method retains mutual authentication, asymmetric ephemeral key
   exchange, and identity protection established by [RFC9528].

   EDHOC with PSK authentication benefits use cases where two nodes
   share a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) provided out-of-band (external PSK).
   This applies to scenarios like the Authenticated Key Management
   Architecture (AKMA) in mobile systems or the Peer and Authenticator
   in Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) systems.  The PSK method
   enables the nodes to perform ephemeral key exchange, achieving
   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).  This ensures that even if the PSK is
   compromised, past communications remain secure against active
   attackers, while future communications are protected from passive
   attackers.  Additionally, by leveraging the PSK for both
   authentication and key derivation, the method offers quantum
   resistance key exchange and authentication even when used with ECDHE.

   Another key use case of PSK authentication in the EDHOC protocol is
   session resumption.  This enables previously connected parties to
   quickly reestablish secure communication using pre-shared keys from a
   prior session, reducing the overhead associated with key exchange and
   asymmetric authentication.  By using PSK authentication, EDHOC allows
   session keys to be refreshed with significantly lower computational
   overhead compared to public-key authentication.  In this case, the
   PSK (resumption PSK) is provisioned after the establishment of a
   previous EDHOC session by using EDHOC_Exporter (resumption PSK).
   Therefore, the external PSK is supposed to be a long-term credential
   while the resumption PSK is a session key.

   Section 3 provides an overview of the PSK method flow and
   credentials.  Section 4 outlines the changes to key derivation
   compared to [RFC9528].  Section 5 details message formatting and
   processing, and Section 6 describes the usage of PSK for resumption.
   Section 7 defines the use of EDHOC-PSK with OSCORE.  Security
   considerations are described in Section 8, and Section 9 outlines the
   IANA considerations.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in EDHOC [RFC9528], CBOR [RFC8949], CBOR Sequences
   [RFC8742], COSE Structures and Processing [RFC9052], COSE Algorithms
   [RFC9053], CWT and CCS [RFC8392], and the Concise Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [RFC8610], which is used to express CBOR data
   structures.

3.  Protocol

   In this method, the Pre-Shared Key identifier (ID_CRED_PSK), which
   allows retrieval of PSK, CRED_I, and CRED_R, is sent in message_3.
   CRED_I and CRED_R are authentication credentials associated with the
   PSK.  The format of CRED_I and CRED_R can vary depending on the
   implementation.  Through this document we will refer to the Pre-
   Shared Key authentication method as EDHOC-PSK.

3.1.  Credentials

   The Initiator and Responder are assumed to share a PSK (external PSK
   or resumption PSK) with good amount of entropy and the following
   requirements:

   *  Only the Initiator and the Responder have access to the PSK.

   *  The Responder is able to retrieve PSK, CRED_I, and CRED_R, using
      ID_CRED_PSK.

3.1.1.  ID_CRED_PSK

   ID_CRED_PSK is a COSE header map containing header parameters that
   can identify a pre-shared key.  For example:

   ID_CRED_PSK = {4 : h'0f' }; 4 = 'kid'

   The purpose of ID_CRED_PSK is to facilitate retrieval of the correct
   PSK.  While ID_CRED_PSK may adopt encoding and representation
   patterns from [RFC9528], it differs fundamentally in that it
   identifies a symmetric key, not a public authentication key.

   It is RECOMMENDED that ID_CRED_PSK uniquely identifies the
   corresponding PSK, since ambiguity may require the recipient to try
   multiple keys.

3.1.2.  CRED_I and CRED_R

   CRED_I and CRED_R are authentication credentials associated with the
   PSK.  Authentication is achieved implicitly via the successful use of
   the PSK to derive keying material and encrypt and posteriorly decrypt
   protected messages.

   A common representation of CRED_I and CRED_R when using an external
   PSK is a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392] whose
   'cnf' claim uses the confirmation method 'COSE_Key' to carry the PSK.
   An example of CRED_I and CRED_R associated with the same PSK would
   be:

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "42-50-31-FF-EF-37-32-39",                /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'0f',                               /kid/
         -1 : h'50930FF462A77A3540CF546325DEA214'  /k/
       }
     }
   }

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "23-11-58-AA-B3-7F-10",                   /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'0f',                               /kid/
         -1 : h'50930FF462A77A3540CF546325DEA214'  /k/
       }
     }
   }

   Alternative formats for CRED_I and CRED_R MAY be used.  When using a
   resumption PSK, CRED_I and CRED_R are the credentials from the
   initial EDHOC exchange and can for example be public-key credentials
   such as certicates.

   Implementations MUST ensure that CRED_I and CRED_R are distict, e.g.,
   by carrying distinct identities in their sub claims (e.g., "42-50-31-
   FF-EF-37-32-39" and "23-11-58-AA-B3-7F-10").  This enables correct
   identification of parties and prevents reflection and misbinding
   attacks, as per Appendix D.2 of [RFC9528].

3.1.3.  Encoding and processing guidelines

   The following guidelines apply to the encoding and handling of CRED_x
   and ID_CRED_PSK.  We use the notation CRED_x to refer to CRED_I or
   CRED_R.  Requirements on CRED_x applies both to CRED_I and to CRED_R.

   *  If CRED_x is CBOR-encoded, it SHOULD use deterministic encoding as
      specified in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. of [RFC8949].  This ensures
      consistent identification and avoids interoperability issues due
      to non-deterministic CBOR variants.

   *  If CRED_x is provisioned out-of-band and transported by value, it
      SHOULD be used as-is without re-encoding.  Re-encoding might cause
      mismatches when comparing identifiers such as hash values or 'kid'
      references.

   *  ID_CRED_PSK SHOULD uniquely identify the corresponding PSK to
      avoid ambiguity.  In cases where ID_CRED_PSK is a reference to a
      key identifier, care must be taken to ensure that 'kid' is unique
      for the PSK.

   *  When ID_CRED_PSK consists solely of a 'kid' parameter (i.e., { 4 :
      kid }), the compact encoding optimization defined in
      Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528] MUST be applied in plaintext fields
      (such as PLAINTEXT_3A).  For example:

      -  { 4 : h'0f' } encoded as h'0f' (CBOR byte string)

      -  { 4 : 21 } encoded as 0x15 (CBOR integer)

   These optimizations MUST NOT be applied in COSE header parameters or
   other contexts where full map structure is required.

   *  To mitigate misbinding attacks, identity information such as a
      'sub' (subject) claim MUST be included in CRED_I and CRED_R.

3.2.  Message Flow of EDHOC-PSK

   The ID_CRED_PSK is sent in message_3, encrypted using a key derived
   from the ephemeral shared secret, G_XY, calculated from the
   Initiator's ephemeral public key G_X or from the encapsulation G_Y
   and the private key corresponding to G_X.  When ECDHE is used, the
   encapsulation G_Y is the Responder's ephemeral public key.  The
   Responder authenticates the Initiator first.  Figure 1 shows the
   message flow of the EDHOC-PSK authentication method.

   Initiator                                                   Responder

   |                                                                   |
   |                           AEAD( EAD_4 )                           |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_4                             |

              Figure 1: Overview of Message Flow of EDHOC-PSK.

   This approach provides identity protection against passive attackers
   for both Initiator and Responder. message_4 remains optional, but is
   needed to authenticate the Responder and achieve mutual
   authentication in EDHOC if not relying on external applications, such
   as OSCORE.  With this fourth message, the protocol achieves both
   explicit key confirmation and mutual authentication.

4.  Key Derivation

   The pseudorandom keys (PRKs) used for the PSK authentication method
   in EDHOC are derived using EDHOC_Extract, as done in [RFC9528].
   EDHOC_Extract allows to derive fixed-length uniformly pseudorandom
   keys (PRKs) from ECDH shared secrets.

   PRK  = EDHOC_Extract( salt, IKM )

   where salt and input keying material (IKM) are defined for each key.
   The definition of EDHOC_Extract depends on the EDHOC hash algorithm
   selected in the cipher suite, see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC9528].

   To maintain a uniform key schedule across the different EDHOC
   authentication methods, the same pseudorandom key notation (PRK_2e,
   PRK_3e2m, and PRK_4e3m) is retained.  In the case of EDHOC with PSK-
   based authentication, no MACs are used.  Consequently, while the
   naming convention suggests involvement in both encryption and MAC
   operations, only the parts related to encryption (2e, 3e, and 4e) are
   relevant.  The index notation does not fully reflect the functional
   role of the keys in this method but is preserved for consistency with
   other EDHOC authentication variants

   The transcript hash TH_2 = H( G_Y, H(message_1) ) is defined as in
   Section 5.3.2 of [RFC9528], the others are modified as specified
   below.

   Figure 2 lists the key derivations that differ from those specified
   in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528].  The following data is used as in
   [RFC9528]:

   *  PRK_2e is extracted with

      -  salt = TH_2, and

      -  IKM = G_XY.

   *  SALT_4e3m is derived from PRK_3e2m and TH_3, see Figure 6 of
      [RFC9528].

    PRK_3e2m     = PRK_2e
    PRK_4e3m     = EDHOC_Extract( SALT_4e3m, PSK )
    KEYSTREAM_3A = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m, 11, TH_3, plaintext_length_3a )
    KEYSTREAM_2A = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_2e,   0, TH_2,  plaintext_length_2a )
    K_3          = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 3, TH_3, key_length )
    IV_3         = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m, 4, TH_3, iv_length )

                   Figure 2: Key Derivation of EDHOC-PSK.

   where:

   *  KEYSTREAM_3A is used to encrypt the PLAINTEXT_3A, a concatenation
      of ID_CRED_PSK and CIPHERTEXT_3B, in message_3.

   *  KEYSTREAM_2A is used to encrypt PLAINTEXT_2A in message_2.

   *  TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2A ).

   *  plaintext_length_2a is the length of PLAINTEXT_2A in message_2.

   *  plaintext_length_3a is the length of PLAINTEXT_3A in message_3.

   Additionally, the definition of the transcript hash TH_4 is modified
   as:

   *  TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3B, CRED_I, CRED_R )

5.  Message Formatting and Processing

   This section specifies the differences in message formatting and
   processing compared to Section 5 of [RFC9528].

5.1.  Message 1

   Message 1 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC9528].

5.2.  Message 2

5.2.1.  Formatting of Message 2

   Message 2 is formatted as specified in Section 5.3.1 of [RFC9528].

5.2.2.  Responder Composition of Message 2

   CIPHERTEXT_2A is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
   using a keystream generated with EDHOC_Expand, and the following
   plaintext:

   *  PLAINTEXT_2A = ( C_R, ? EAD_2 )

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2A = PLAINTEXT_2A XOR KEYSTREAM_2A

   Contrary to [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R, MAC_2, and Signature_or_MAC_2 are
   not used.  C_R, EAD_2 are defined in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC9528].
   KESYTREAM_2A is defined in Section 4.

5.2.3.  Initiator Processing of Message 2

   Upon receiving message_2, the Initiator processes it as follows:

   *  It computes KEYSTREAM_2A, following Section 4, where
      plaintext_length_2a is the length of PLAINTEXT_2A.

   *  It decrypts CIPHERTEXT_2A using binary XOR, i.e., PLAINTEXT_2A =
      CIPHERTEXT_2A XOR KEYSTREAM_2A

   Compared to Section 5.3.3 of [RFC9528], ID_CRED_R is not made
   available to the application in step 4, and steps 5 and 6 are skipped

5.3.  Message 3

5.3.1.  Formatting of Message 3

   Message 3 is formatted as specified in Section 5.4.1 of [RFC9528].

5.3.2.  Initiator Composition of Message 3

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3A is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
      using a keystream generated with EDHOC_Expand, and the following
      plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK / bstr / -24..23, CIPHERTEXT_3B )

         o  If ID_CRED_PSK contains a single 'kid' parameter, i.e.,
            ID_CRED_PSK = { 4 : kid_PSK }, then the compact encoding is
            applied, see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].

         o  If the length of PLAINTEXT_3A exceeds the output of
            EDHOC_KDF, then Appendix G of [RFC9528] applies.

      -  Compute KEYSTREAM_3A as in Section 4, where plaintext_length_3a
         is the length of PLAINTEXT_3A.

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3A = PLAINTEXT_3A XOR KEYSTREAM_3A

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3B is the 'ciphertext' of COSE_Encrypt0 object as
      defined in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of [RFC9528], with the
      EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher suite, using the
      encryption key K_3, the initialization vector IV_3 (if used by the
      AEAD algorithm), the parameters described in Section 5.2 of
      [RFC9528], plaintext PLAINTEXT_3B and the following parameters as
      input:

      -  protected = h''

      -  external_aad = << ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_I, CRED_R >>

      -  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4

      -  PLAINTEXT_3B = ( ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3B,
   CRED_I, CRED_R ), defined in Section 4.

   There is no need for MAC_3 or signature, since AEAD's built-in
   integrity and the use of PSK-based key derivation provides implicit
   authentication of the Initiator.

5.3.3.  Responder Processing of Message 3

   Upon receiving message_3, the Responder performs the following steps:

   *  Derive the decryption key K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4.

   *  Parse the structure of message_3, which consists of a stream-
      cipher encrypted structure, CIPHERTEXT_3A = PLAINTEXT_3A XOR
      KEYSTREAM_3A, where PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK, CIPHERTEXT_3B )
      and CIPHERTEXT_3B is the inner AEAD-encrypted object.

   *  Generate KEYSTREAM_3A with the same method the initiator used.

   *  Decrypt CIPHERTEXT_3A using binary XOR with KEYSTREAM_3A,
      resulting in PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK, CIPHERTEXT_3B ).

   *  Validate or match ID_CRED_PSK to identify which PSK to use.  If
      the ID is unrecognized, the Responder aborts.

   *  AEAD-decrypt CIPHERTEXT_3B using:

      -  K_3, IV_3

      -  external_aad = << ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_I, CRED_R >>

      -  protected = h''

      -  AEAD algorithm from cipher suite

   If verification fails, this indicates either the Initiator does not
   know the correct PSK, or the message was tampered with.  Contrary, if
   verification succeeds, the Responder concludes that the Initiator
   knows the correct PSK, has correctly derived the transcript hash TH_3
   and is actively participating in the protocol.

   Lastly, the Responder computes TH_4 as defined in Section 4

   No MAC_3 or signature is needed, as the AEAD tag guarantees both
   integrity and authenticity in this symmetric setting.

5.4.  Message 4

   Message 4 is formatted and processed as specified in Section 5.5 of
   [RFC9528].

   Compared to [RFC9528], a fourth message does not only provide key
   confirmation but also Responder authentication.  To authenticate the
   Responder and achieve mutual authentication, a fourth message is
   mandatory.

   After verifying message_4, the Initiator is assured that the
   Responder has calculated the key PRK_out (key confirmation) and that
   no other party can derive the key.  The Initiator MUST NOT
   persistently store PRK_out or application keys until the Initiator
   has verified message_4 or a message protected with a derived
   application key, such as an OSCORE message, from the Responder and
   the application has authenticated the Responder.

6.  PSK usage for Session Resumption

   This section defines how PSKs are used for session resumption in
   EDHOC.  Following Section 4.2 of [RFC9528], EDHOC_Exporter is used to
   derive both rPSK and rID_CRED_PSK:

   rPSK = EDHOC_Exporter( 2, h'', resumption_psk_length )
   rKID  = EDHOC_Exporter( 3, h'', id_cred_psk_length )
   rID_CRED_PSK = { 4 : rKID }

   where:

   *  resumption_psk_length is by default the key_length (length of the
      encryption key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher
      suite) of the session in which the EDHOC_Exporter is called.

   *  id_cred_psk_length is by default 2.

   A peer that has successfully completed an EDHOC session, regardless
   of the used authentication method and regardless of if the session is
   a PSK resumption session, MUST generate a resumption key to use for
   the next resumption in the present "session series", as long as it
   supports PSK resumption.  To guarantee that both peers share the same
   resumption key, when a session is run using rPSK_i as a resumption
   key:

   *  The Initiator can delete rPSK_i after having successfully verified
      EDHOC message_4.  In this case, the Responder will have derived
      the next rPSK_(i+1), which the Initiator can know for sure, upon
      receiving EDHOC message_4.

   *  The Responder can delete rPSK_(i-1), if any, after having
      successfully sent EDHOC message_4.  That is, upon receiving EDHOC
      message_3, the Responder knows for sure that the other peer did
      derive rPSK_i at the end of the previous session in the "session
      series", thus making it safe to delete the previous resumption key
      rPSK_(i-1).

6.1.  Cipher Suite Requirements for Resumption

   When using a resumption PSK derived from a previous EDHOC exchange:

   1.  The resumption PSK MUST only be used with the same cipher suite
       that was used in the original EDHOC exchange, or with a cipher
       suite that provides equal or higher security guarantees.

   2.  Implementations SHOULD maintain a mapping between the resumption
       PSK and its originating cipher suite to enforce this requirement.

   3.  If a resumption PSK is offered with a cipher suite different from
       the one used in the original EDHOC session, the recipient can
       fail the present EDHOC session according to application-specific
       policies.

6.2.  Privacy Considerations for Resumption

   When using resumption PSKs:

   *  During normal operation, the same same ID_CRED_PSK is not reused,
      and not visible to a passive attacker.  Reuse of the same
      ID_CRED_PSK can however happen due to transmission errors or when
      one peer lose its stored resumption key.  An active attacker can
      force reuse of the same ID_CRED_PSK and decrypt ID_CRED_PSK.  This
      is seen as a minor privacy problem.  EDHOC-PSK provides much
      stronger privacy properties than many other popular protocols with
      PSK authentication.

6.3.  Security Considerations for Resumption

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST NOT be used for purposes other than EDHOC
      session resumption.

   *  Resumption PSKs MUST be securely stored with the same level of
      protection as the original session keys.

   *  Parties SHOULD implement mechanisms to detect and prevent
      excessive reuse of the same resumption PSK.

7.  EDHOC PSK and OSCORE

   When PSK authentication is used and the Initiator is able to derive
   PRK_out before sending message_3, then the optimization described in
   Section 3 of [RFC9668] applies.  In this scenario, the Initiator MAY
   concatenate EDHOC message_3 and the first OSCORE request in a single
   CoAP message.

8.  Security Considerations

   The EDHOC-PSK authentication method introduces changes with respect
   to the current specification of EDHOC [RFC9528].  This section
   analyzes the security implications of these changes.

8.1.  Identity protection

   EDHOC-PSK encrypts ID_CRED_PSK in message 3 with a keystream derived
   from the ephemeral shared secret G_XY.  As a consequence, contrary to
   the current EDHOC methods that protect the Initiator’s identity
   against active attackers and the Responder’s identity against passive
   attackers (See Section 9.1 of [RFC9528]), EDHOC-PSK provides identity
   protection for both the Initiator and the Responder against passive
   attackers.

   In symmetric key setups, using the same CRED_x for both parties makes
   the protocol vulnerable to reflection or Selfie attacks.  Separate
   identities in sub serve as non-cryptographic role binders and MUST be
   distinct.

8.2.  Mutual Authentication

   EDHOC-PSK provides mutual authentication, assuming the PSK remains
   secret.  However, if the optional fourth message (message_4) is
   omitted, mutual authentication is not guaranteed—unless the Responder
   is later authenticated through an OSCORE message or other application
   data demonstrating possession of the PSK.  When message_4 is
   included, the protocol ensures both mutual authentication and
   explicit key confirmation.

8.3.  External Authorization Data Protection

   Similarly to [RFC9528], EDHOC-PSK provides external authorization
   data protection.  The integrity and confidentiality of EAD fields
   follow the same security guarantees as in the original EDHOC
   specification.

8.4.  Post Quantum Considerations

   Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest that the development
   of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is likely
   feasible long-term.  If realized, such a machine would render many
   currently deployed asymmetric cryptographic algorithms—such as
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)—insecure.

   By leveraging a symmetric PSK for both authentication and key
   derivation, EDHOC-PSK provides quantum-resistant key exchange and
   authentication, even when used with ECDHE.  However, if a
   cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) is realized, the
   ECDHE component would be broken and contribute only randomness.
   Consequently, EDHOC-PSK with ECDHE does not offer identity protection
   or Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) against quantum-capable adversaries.
   If the PSK is compromised, a passive quantum attacker could decrypt
   both past and future sessions.  In contrast, EDHOC-PSK combined with
   a quantum-resistant Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), such as ML-
   KEM, provides identity protection and PFS even in the presence of a
   quantum attacker.

8.5.  Independence of Session Keys

   NIST mandates that an ephemeral private key shall be used in exactly
   one key-establishment transaction (see Section 5.6.3.3 of
   [SP-800-56A]).  This requirement is essential for preserving session
   key independence and ensuring forward secrecy.  The EDHOC-PSK
   protocol complies with this NIST requirement.

   In other protocols, the reuse of ephemeral keys, particularly when
   combined with implementation flaws such as the absence of public key
   validation, has resulted in critical security vulnerabilities.  Such
   weaknesses have allowed attackers to recover the so called
   “ephemeral” private key from a compromised session, thereby enabling
   them to compromise the security of both past and future sessions
   between legitimate parties.  Assuming breach and minimizing the
   impact of compromise are fundamental zero-trust principles.

8.6.  Unified Approach and Recommendations

   For use cases involving the transmission of application data,
   application data can be sent concurrently with message_3, maintaining
   the protocol's efficiency.  In applications such as EAP-EDHOC, where
   application data is not sent, message_4 is mandatory.  Thus, the
   EDHOC-PSK authentication method does not include any extra messages.
   Other implementations may continue using OSCORE in place of EDHOC
   message_4, with a required change in the protocol's language to: The
   Initiator SHALL NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until the Initiator has verified message_4 or a message protected
   with a derived application key, such as an OSCORE message.

   This change ensures that key materials are only stored once their
   integrity and authenticity are confirmed, thereby enhancing privacy
   by preventing early storage of potentially compromised keys.

   Lastly, whether the Initiator or Responder authenticates first is not
   relevant when using symmetric keys.  This consideration was important
   for the privacy properties when using asymmetric authentication but
   is not significant in the context of symmetric key usage.
